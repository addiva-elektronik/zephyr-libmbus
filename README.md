Zephyr Port of libmbus
======================

> **Note:** This is the Zephyr port of the M-bus Library from [Raditex
> Control][1].  For the original, see https://github.com/rscada/libmbus

libmbus is an open source library for the M-bus (Meter-Bus) protocol available
under the 3-clause [BSD license][2].

The Meter-Bus is a standard for reading out meter data from electricity meters,
heat meters, gas meters, etc. The M-bus standard deals with both the electrical
signals on the M-Bus, and the protocol and data format used in transmissions on
the M-Bus. The role of libmbus is to decode/encode M-bus data, and to handle
the communication with M-Bus devices.
